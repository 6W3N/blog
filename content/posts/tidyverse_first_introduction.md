## Tidyverse

Tidyverse has three meanings:

- Concept:  
to use "tidy data" and to make the design of the tools used for data analyze more tidy.
- Packages:  
to manipulate data handling or data visualizing based on tidyverse (concept).
- Organization:  
is managing `tidyverse` (packages).


Today I explain about `tidyverse` (packages) mainly.

Recently, [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which became one of the dialects in R languages, is a powerful and useful collection of packages. 
Many codes on the web are written using `tidyverse`.
So, if you want to learn R on the web, there is no less to know `tidyverse`.

I strongly recommend to read and demonstrate "R for Data Science ([R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/))" for studying `tidyverse` or data handling skills in R.
But this book has so many contents so that focus on some of them at this lecture.



First of all, to load the `tidyverse` and make it available in your current R session.
```
install.packages("tidyverse") #if you have not installed tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```


#### Core tidyverse
NOTE: The following list is just only my thoughts.

- tidyr (create tidy data)
- dplyr (data transformation)
- purrr (apply function)
- ggplot2 (data visualization)
- stringr (string manipulation)
- readr (data import)

Today, I will explain only about `tidyr` and `dplyr`.
If you want to learn about other packages in `tidyverse`, please refer to [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) or [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or [Heavy Watal (jp lang)](https://heavywatal.github.io/rstats/intro.html).

## tidyr

Almost packages in `tidyverse` operate based on "tidy data". 
Not only that, we can understand its meanings simply using "tidy data."  
But in the real world, we often encounter "non-tidy data".
The `tidyr` package allows us to create "tidy data" easily.

#### What is "tidy data"?

"tidy": arranged neatly and in order.

Hadley Wickham defined "tidy data" as follows.

>  In tidy data:  
> 1. Each variable forms a column.  
> 2. Each observation forms a row.  
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

by [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

#### Examples of "tidy data" and "non-tidy data"
"Tidy data" is like this:

```
table1 

#> # A tibble: 6 x 4
#>   country      year  cases population
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
```

Each column means variables, and each row represents observations.   
On the other hands, "non-tidy data" are like these:

```
table2

#> # A tibble: 12 x 4
#>   country      year type           count
#>   <chr>       <int> <chr>          <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 cases            745
#> 2 Afghanistan  1999 population  19987071
#> 3 Afghanistan  2000 cases           2666
#> 4 Afghanistan  2000 population  20595360
#> 5 Brazil       1999 cases          37737
#> 6 Brazil       1999 population 172006362
#> # â€¦ with 6 more rows
```
Because two types (cases and population) are common to country column and year column, table2 is "non-tidy data".

```
table3

#> # A tibble: 6 x 3
#>   country      year rate             
#> * <chr>       <int> <chr>            
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 745/19987071     
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666/20595360    
#> 3 Brazil       1999 37737/172006362  
#> 4 Brazil       2000 80488/174504898  
#> 5 China        1999 212258/1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766/1280428583
```
Because rate column consists of denominator and numerator, table3 is also "non-tidy data".


#### Functions of tidyr

##### `gather`

```
table4a

#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   country     `1999` `2000`
#> * <chr>        <int>  <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan    745   2666
#> 2 Brazil       37737  80488
#> 3 China       212258 213766
```
table4a contains year (1999 or 2000), but each year are columns. "gather" function takes multiple columns and collapses into key-value pairs, duplicating all other columns as needed.

```
gather(table4a, `1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")

#> # A tibble: 6 x 3
#>   country     year   cases
#>   <chr>       <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan 1999     745
#> 2 Brazil      1999   37737
#> 3 China       1999  212258
#> 4 Afghanistan 2000    2666
#> 5 Brazil      2000   80488
#> 6 China       2000  213766
```

Above scripts changed table4a to "tidy data".

by [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

##### `spread`
`spread` function is the opposite of gathering. 
table2 have observations which are scattered across multiple rows.

```
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)

#> # A tibble: 6 x 4
#>   country      year  cases population
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
```

by [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


The `tidyr` package has more functions but the above lecture only introduces to `spread` and `gather` due to time.

More functions are [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf).
Or we can confirm functions by running following commands.

```
help(package = "tidyr")
```


## dplyr
`dplyr` is a powerful tool to transform data, like summarising, grouping, manipulating cases, manipulating variables, even combination.


#### pipe operator
`%>%` will forward a value, or the result of an expression, into the next function call/expression. 
Actually, the pipe operator is function from `magrittr` package which is one of `tidyverse`.

The pipe operator makes R scripts more simple, readable, and hence easy to edit.
This is because nested functions (the first script)  are difficult to read and also lots of variables (the second script) confuse us.




Following two scripts will return same results.

```
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```

or

```
table2 %>%
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```

`%>%` operator would demonstrate its power when applying many  functions in one process.

Following three scripts also return the same result. 

```
mutate(spread(filter(table2, country=="Afghanistan"),key = type, value = count), ratio=population/cases)
# `mutate` function will be discribed later.
```

or

```
Af <- filter(table2, country=="Afghanistan")
spreadAf <- spread(Af, key = type, value = count)
mutate(spreadAf, ratio=population/cases)
```

but  you can utilize pipe operator,

```
table2 %>% 
  filter(country=="Afghanistan") %>% 
  spread(key = type, value = count) %>% 
  mutate(ratio=population/cases)
```

The first two are traditional R scripts. 
On the other hand, the third is a modern R script.

I strongly recommend using the pipe operator to make your code simple and readable.
And I write all scripts using the pipe operator from here on.


#### functions of dplyr
I will explain only some of the functions because `dplyr` also has so many useful functions.

##### `mutate`
`mutate` function adds new variables, as used in the above scripts. 

```
table1 %>% 
  mutate(ratio=population/cases)
```

Of course, `mutate` function can add columns using another dataset.

```
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate=table3$rate)
```

In dialect `tidyverse`, it is common to access the columns as follows:

```
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate=table3 %>% pull(rate))
```

Like above, `%>%` is also valid when passing as arguments. 
`pull` command access the variables in the data frame.

`mutate` function is so useful but we must pass data of the same length as the original data frame. 
If based on the `tidyverse` concept, we should operate at variables (columns) level of the data frame as possible. 
So, we will often use `mutate` function.

##### `select`
The `select` function filters the column levels.

If you want to do as same as `table1$year`, you should use `pull` command which is one of the commands in `dplyr`.
 
The `pull` command  or `$` operator return the `data.frameRowLabels` type. 
But `select` function returns the `data.frame` type which columns name remains. 

```
table1 %>% 
  select(countey)
```

##### `filter`
The `filter` function filters the row levels.
`filter` function returns matched row when matching arguments.

```
table1 %>% 
  filter(country=="Afghanistan")
```
The above commands return rows including `"Afghanistan"` in `country` column.

Of course, you can also select by row numbers as below. 
But if so, you have to use `slice` function.

```
table1 %>% 
  slice(1)
```

by [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)


##### `inner_join`
The `_join` function group (`left_`, `right_`, `inner_` `full_`) combine two data. 
The easiest to use function is `inner_join` which combine and returns only the rows that match the column specified by `by`. 

```
table2 %>%
  inner_join(table3, by=c("country", "year"))
```

The above commands returns the data combined with `country` and `year` columns.

__The following figure is for illustrative purposes.__  
`x` has `a, b, and c` in `A` column and `t, u, and v` in `B` column. 
On the other hand, `y` has the same variable as `x` like `a and b` in `A` column and `t and u` in `B` column. 
In this case, `inner_join` combine as below:

##### `group_by`
`group_by` function makes groups. 
This function is compatible with `summarize` function.


##### `summarize`
The `summarize` function summarize variables and create a new table of summary statistics.

```
mtcars %>% 
  as_tibble()    # tibble is easy to read and use class because we can confirm all variable's names, numbers of rows and columns, and columns class.


#> # A tibble: 32 x 11
#>    mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb

#># â€¦ with 22 more rows
```


```
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%    # grouping by `cyl` levels, which are 4, 6, or 8.
  summarise(avg = mean(mpg))    # summarizing by the group (is `cyl` levels), and creation the averages column.
