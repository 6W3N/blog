## SEM Photo of Bean weevils

Males of _Callasobruchus maculatus_ have exaggerated spins on genitalias. These spins often hurt their mates.  
They have been treated as model organisms of sexual conflict by these harmful spins.  
  
The two photos belows show male genitalias of two geographic strains, implying that the intensity of sexual conflict (and also sexual selection) varied depending on strains.

I could take these photos with the help of Mr. Takayuki Yamamoto and Dr. Ryuichiro Machida.
