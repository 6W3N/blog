## Arnqvist's Lab.

Before ESEB 2019, I visited <a href="http://arnqvist.org/">Arnqvist Lab.</a>, Uppsala, Sweden.
Thank you to Dr. GÃ¶ran Arnqvist for talking to me about the research equipment and how to rear bean weevils.
And thank you to everyone at Arnqvist Lab. for taking the time to do this, regardless of the summer break.

The photo is a bust of Carolus Linnaeus who is known as the "father of modern taxonomy".
As a student of biology, I am delighted to be able to visit university associated with him.
